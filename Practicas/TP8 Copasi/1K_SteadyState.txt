Stability Analysis of the Reduced System

KINETIC STABILITY ANALYSIS
The linear stability analysis based on the eigenvalues
of the Jacobian matrix is only valid for steady states.

Summary:
This state is asymptotically stable.

 1 are purely real
 0 are purely imaginary
 0 are complex
 0 are equal to zero
 0 have positive real part
 1 have negative real part
 stiffness = 1.00000
 time hierarchy = -nan
