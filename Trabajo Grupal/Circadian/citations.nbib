AB  - Oscillation is one of the most important phenomena in the chemical reaction
      systems in living cells. The general purpose simulation algorithms fail to take
      into account this special character and produce unsatisfying results. In order to
      enhance the accuracy of the integrator, the second-order derivative is
      incorporated in the scheme. The oscillatory feature of the solution is captured
      by the integrators with an exponential fitting property. Three practical
      exponentially fitted TDRK (EFTDRK) methods are derived. To test the effectiveness
      of the new EFTDRK methods, the two-gene system with cross-regulation and the
      circadian oscillation of the period protein in Drosophila are simulated. Each
      EFTDRK method has the best fitting frequency which minimizes the global error.
      The numerical results show that the new EFTDRK methods are more accurate and more
      efficient than their prototype TDRK methods or RK methods of the same order and
      the traditional exponentially fitted RK method in the literature.

AB  - Self-sustaining oscillations are essential for diverse physiological functions
      such as the cell cycle, insulin secretion and circadian rhythms. Synthetic
      oscillators using biochemical feedback circuits have been generated in cell
      culture. These synthetic systems provide important insight into design principles
      for biological oscillators, but have limited similarity to physiological
      pathways. Here we report the generation of an artificial, mammalian circadian
      clock in vivo, capable of generating robust, tunable circadian rhythms. In mice
      deficient in Per1 and Per2 genes (thus lacking circadian rhythms), we
      artificially generate PER2 rhythms and restore circadian sleep/wake cycles with
      an inducible Per2 transgene. Our artificial clock is tunable as the period and
      phase of the rhythms can be modulated predictably. This feature, and other design
      principles of our work, might enhance the study and treatment of circadian
      dysfunction and broader aspects of physiology involving biological oscillators.

AB  - Microarray gene expression data can provide insights into biological processes at
      a system-wide level and is commonly used for reverse engineering gene regulatory 
      networks (GRN). Due to the amalgamation of noise from different sources,
      microarray expression profiles become inherently noisy leading to significant
      impact on the GRN reconstruction process. Microarray replicates (both biological 
      and technical), generated to increase the reliability of data obtained under
      noisy conditions, have limited influence in enhancing the accuracy of
      reconstruction . Therefore, instead of the conventional GRN modeling approaches
      which are deterministic, stochastic techniques are becoming increasingly
      necessary for inferring GRN from noisy microarray data. In this paper, we propose
      a new stochastic GRN model by investigating incorporation of various standard
      noise measurements in the deterministic S-system model. Experimental evaluations 
      performed for varying sizes of synthetic network, representing different
      stochastic processes, demonstrate the effect of noise on the accuracy of genetic 
      network modeling and the significance of stochastic modeling for GRN
      reconstruction . The proposed stochastic model is subsequently applied to infer
      the regulations among genes in two real life networks: (1) the well-studied IRMA 
      network, a real-life in-vivo synthetic network constructed within the
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, and (2) the SOS DNA repair network in Escherichia
      coli.

AB  - Cellular rhythms regulate various physiological functions in circadian
      oscillatory mechanisms. Weight cycling or 'yo-yo' dieting is an evitable process 
      in human, because of subsequent loss and regain of body weight due to irregular
      diet. Human weight cycle (HWC) is the major factor for causing global epidemic
      diseases in human beings. Understanding the HWC process would provide potent
      additional knowledge to prevent obesity. However till date, there is no study
      dealing with examine the HWC model using virtual cell simulation based on system 
      biological approach. Therefore, the present study was designed to develop a
      computational HWC model, which was simulated using E-cell system v3.0. The
      developed model has the cyclic feedback reactions of three significant variables 
      (the consecutive cycles of weight loss in continuous food intake (Q) and regain
      of body weight (P) at highest threshold point of cognitive restraint (R)) which
      are obtained by mathematical modelling. The dynamic plot results supported that
      the PQR variables depicted sustained oscillation with reversible modification due
      to protein diet. By contrast, the virtual model simulation would provide
      extensive information on HWC, which might provide knowledge to develop HWC linked
      with obesity pathway. The presents study concludes that optimization of body
      weight is essential to prevent the obesity based diseases.

AB  - Biological systems exhibit numerous oscillatory behaviors from calcium
      oscillations to circadian rhythms that recur daily. These autonomous oscillators 
      contain complex feedbacks with nonlinear dynamics that enable spontaneous
      oscillations. The detailed nonlinear dynamics of such systems remains largely
      unknown. In this paper, we investigate robustness and dynamical differences of
      five minimal systems that may underlie fundamental molecular processes in
      biological oscillatory systems. Bifurcation analyses of these five models
      demonstrate an increase of oscillatory domains with a positive feedback mechanism
      that incorporates a reversible reaction, and dramatic changes in dynamics with
      small modifications in the wiring. Furthermore, our parameter sensitivity
      analysis and stochastic simulations reveal different rankings of hierarchy of
      period robustness that are determined by the number of sensitive parameters or
      network topology. In addition, systems with autocatalytic positive feedback loop 
      are shown to be more robust than those with positive feedback via inhibitory
      degradation regardless of noise type. We demonstrate that robustness has to be
      comprehensively assessed with both parameter sensitivity analysis and stochastic 
      simulations.

      Damage Response.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004144 [doi]
AB  - The circadian clock is a set of regulatory steps that oscillate with a period of 
      approximately 24 hours influencing many biological processes. These oscillations 
      are robust to external stresses, and in the case of genotoxic stress (i.e. DNA
      damage), the circadian clock responds through phase shifting with primarily phase
      advancements. The effect of DNA damage on the circadian clock and the mechanism
      through which this effect operates remains to be thoroughly investigated. Here we
      build an in silico model to examine damage-induced circadian phase shifts by
      investigating a possible mechanism linking circadian rhythms to metabolism. The
      proposed model involves two DNA damage response proteins, SIRT1 and PARP1, that
      are each consumers of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a metabolite
      involved in oxidation-reduction reactions and in ATP synthesis. This model builds
      on two key findings: 1) that SIRT1 (a protein deacetylase) is involved in both
      the positive (i.e. transcriptional activation) and negative (i.e. transcriptional
      repression) arms of the circadian regulation and 2) that PARP1 is a major
      consumer of NAD during the DNA damage response. In our simulations, we observe
      that increased PARP1 activity may be able to trigger SIRT1-induced circadian
      phase advancements by decreasing SIRT1 activity through competition for NAD
      supplies. We show how this competitive inhibition may operate through protein
      acetylation in conjunction with phosphorylation, consistent with reported
      observations. These findings suggest a possible mechanism through which multiple 
      perturbations, each dominant during different points of the circadian cycle, may 
      result in the phase advancement of the circadian clock seen during DNA damage.

      flies, suggesting that translational regulation of clock components is important 
      for the proper clock gene expression and molecular clock performance. Because
      translational regulation ultimately implies changes in the kinetics of
      translation and, therefore, in the circadian clock dynamics, we sought to study
      how and to what extent the molecular clock dynamics is affected by the kinetics
      of PER translation. With this objective, we used a minimal mathematical model of 
      the molecular circadian clock to qualitatively characterize the dynamical changes
      derived from kinetically different PER translational mechanisms. We found that
      the emergence of self-sustained oscillations with characteristic period,
      amplitude, and phase lag (time delays) between per mRNA and protein expression
      depends on the kinetic parameters related to PER translation. Interestingly,
      under certain conditions, a PER translation mechanism with saturable kinetics
      introduces longer time delays than a mechanism ruled by a first-order kinetics.
      In addition, the kinetic laws of PER translation significantly changed the
      sensitivity of our model to parameters related to the synthesis and degradation
      of per mRNA and PER degradation. Lastly, we found a set of parameters, with
      realistic values, for which our model reproduces some experimental results
      reported recently for Drosophila melanogaster and we present some predictions
      derived from our analysis.

AB  - Biochemical reaction networks are subjected to large fluctuations attributable to
      small molecule numbers, yet underlie reliable biological functions. Thus, it is
      important to understand how regularity can emerge from noise. Here, we study the 
      stochastic dynamics of a self-repressing gene with arbitrarily long or short
      response time. We find that when the mRNA and protein half-lives are
      approximately equal to the gene response time, fluctuations can induce relatively
      regular oscillations in the protein concentration. To gain insight into this
      phenomenon at the crossroads of determinism and stochasticity, we use an
      intermediate theoretical approach, based on a moment-closure approximation of the
      master equation, which allows us to take into account the binary character of
      gene activity. We thereby obtain differential equations that describe how
      nonlinearity can feed-back fluctuations into the mean-field equations to trigger 
      oscillations. Finally, our results suggest that the self-repressing Hes1 gene
      circuit exploits this phenomenon to generate robust oscillations, inasmuch as its
      time constants satisfy precisely the conditions we have identified.

TI  - An intensity ratio of interlocking loops determines circadian period length.
PG  - 10278-87
LID - 10.1093/nar/gku701 [doi]
AB  - Circadian clocks allow organisms to orchestrate the daily rhythms in physiology
      and behaviors, and disruption of circadian rhythmicity can profoundly affect
      fitness. The mammalian circadian oscillator consists of a negative primary
      feedback loop and is associated with some 'auxiliary' loops. This raises the
      questions of how these interlocking loops coordinate to regulate the period and
      maintain its robustness. Here, we focused on the REV-ERBalpha/Cry1 auxiliary
      loop, consisting of Rev-Erbalpha/ROR-binding elements (RORE) mediated Cry1
      transcription, coordinates with the negative primary feedback loop to modulate
      the mammalian circadian period. The silicon simulation revealed an unexpected
      rule: the intensity ratio of the primary loop to the auxiliary loop is inversely 
      related to the period length, even when post-translational feedback is fixed.
      Then we measured the mRNA levels from two loops in 10-mutant mice and observed
      the similar monotonic relationship. Additionally, our simulation and the
      experimental results in human osteosarcoma cells suggest that a coupling effect
      between the numerator and denominator of this intensity ratio ensures the
      robustness of circadian period and, therefore, provides an efficient means of
      correcting circadian disorders. This ratio rule highlights the contribution of
      the transcriptional architecture to the period dynamics and might be helpful in
      the construction of synthetic oscillators.

AB  - The paper investigates the observer design for a core circadian rhythm network in
      Drosophila and Neurospora. Based on the constructed highly nonlinear differential
      equation model and the recently proposed graphical approach, we design a rather
      simple observer for the circadian rhythm oscillator, which can well track the
      state of the original system for various input signals. Numerical simulations
      show the effectiveness of the designed observer. Potential applications of the
      related investigations include the real-world control and experimental design of 
      the related biological networks.

LID - 10.1155/2014/683235 [doi]
AB  - The splitting approach is developed for the numerical simulation of genetic
      regulatory networks with a stable steady-state structure. The numerical results
      of the simulation of a one-gene network, a two-gene network, and a p53-mdm2
      network show that the new splitting methods constructed in this paper are
      remarkably more effective and more suitable for long-term computation with large 
      steps than the traditional general-purpose Runge-Kutta methods. The new methods
      have no restriction on the choice of stepsize due to their infinitely large
      stability regions.

TI  - Changes in oscillatory dynamics in the cell cycle of early Xenopus laevis
      embryos.
PG  - e1001788
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001788 [doi]
AB  - During the early development of Xenopus laevis embryos, the first mitotic cell
      cycle is long ( approximately 85 min) and the subsequent 11 cycles are short (
      approximately 30 min) and clock-like. Here we address the question of how the
      Cdk1 cell cycle oscillator changes between these two modes of operation. We found
      that the change can be attributed to an alteration in the balance between
      Wee1/Myt1 and Cdc25. The change in balance converts a circuit that acts like a
      positive-plus-negative feedback oscillator, with spikes of Cdk1 activation, to
      one that acts like a negative-feedback-only oscillator, with a shorter period and
      smoothly varying Cdk1 activity. Shortening the first cycle, by treating embryos
      with the Wee1A/Myt1 inhibitor PD0166285, resulted in a dramatic reduction in
      embryo viability, and restoring the length of the first cycle in
      inhibitor-treated embryos with low doses of cycloheximide partially rescued
      viability. Computations with an experimentally parameterized mathematical model
      show that modest changes in the Wee1/Cdc25 ratio can account for the observed
      qualitative changes in the cell cycle. The high ratio in the first cycle allows
      the period to be long and tunable, and decreasing the ratio in the subsequent
      cycles allows the oscillator to run at a maximal speed. Thus, the embryo rewires 
      its feedback regulation to meet two different developmental requirements during
      early development.

AB  - Systems biologists increasingly use network representations to investigate
      biochemical pathways and their dynamic behaviours. In this critical review, we
      discuss four commonly used network representations of chemical and biochemical
      pathways. We illustrate how some of these representations reduce network
      complexity but result in the ambiguous representation of biochemical pathways. We
      also examine the current theoretical approaches available to investigate the
      dynamic behaviour of chemical and biochemical networks. Finally, we describe how 
      the critical chemical and biochemical pathways responsible for emergent dynamic
      behaviour can be identified using network mining and functional mapping
      approaches.

TI  - Transcription fluctuation effects on biochemical oscillations.

AB  - Some biochemical systems show oscillation. They often consist of feedback loops
      with repressive transcription regulation. Such biochemical systems have
      distinctive characteristics in comparison with ordinary chemical systems: i)
      numbers of molecules involved are small, ii) there are typically only a couple of
      genes in a cell with a finite regulation time. Due to the fluctuations caused by 
      these features, the system behavior can be quite different from the one by
      deterministic rate equations, because the rate equations ignore molecular
      fluctuations and thus are exact only in the infinite molecular number limit. The 
      molecular fluctuations on a free-running circadian system have been studied by
      Gonze et al. (2002) by introducing a scale parameter [Formula: see text] for the 
      system size. They consider, however, only the first effect, assuming that the
      gene process is fast enough for the second effect to be ignored, but this has not
      been examined systematically yet. Here we study fluctuation effects due to the
      finite gene regulation time by introducing a new scale parameter [Formula: see
      text], which we take as the unbinding time of a nuclear protein from the gene. We
      focus on the case where the fluctuations due to small molecular numbers are
      negligible. In simulations on the same system studied by Gonze et al., we find
      the system is unexpectedly sensitive to the fluctuation in the transcription
      regulation; the period of oscillation fluctuates about 30 min even when the
      regulation time scale [Formula: see text] is around 30 s, that is even smaller
      than 1/1000 of its circadian period. We also demonstrate that the distribution
      width for the oscillation period and amplitude scales with [Formula: see text],
      and the correlation time scales with [Formula: see text] in the small [Formula:
      see text] regime. The relative fluctuations for the period are about half of that
      for the amplitude, namely, the periodicity is more stable than the amplitude.

TI  - Bifurcation theory and cardiac arrhythmias.
PG  - 1-16
AB  - In this paper we review two types of dynamic behaviors defined by the bifurcation
      theory that are found to be particularly useful in describing two forms of
      cardiac electrical instabilities that are of considerable importance in cardiac
      arrhythmogenesis. The first is action potential duration (APD) alternans with an 
      underlying dynamics consistent with the period doubling bifurcation theory. This 
      form of electrical instability could lead to spatially discordant APD alternans
      leading to wavebreak and reentrant form of tachyarrhythmias. Factors that
      modulate the APD alternans are discussed. The second form of bifurcation of
      importance to cardiac arrhythmogenesis is the Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation that
      adequately describes the dynamics of the onset of early afterdepolarization
      (EAD)-mediated triggered activity (Hopf) that may cause ventricular tachycardia
      and ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF respectively). The self-termination of the
      triggered activity is compatible with the homoclinic bifurcation. Ionic and
      intracellular calcium dynamics underlying these dynamics are discussed using
      available experimental and simulation data. The dynamic analysis provides novel
      insights into the mechanisms of VT/VF, a major cause of sudden cardiac death in
      the US.

AB  - Animal and clinical studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress, a common
      pathophysiological factor in cardiac disease, reduces repolarization reserve by
      enhancing the L-type calcium current, the late Na, and the Na-Ca exchanger,
      promoting early afterdepolarizations (EADs) that can initiate ventricular
      tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) in structurally remodeled
      hearts. Increased ventricular fibrosis plays a key facilitatory role in allowing 
      oxidative-stress induced EADs to manifest as triggered activity and VT/VF, since 
      normal non-fibrotic hearts are resistant to arrhythmias when challenged with
      similar or higher levels of oxidative stress. The findings imply that
      antifibrotic therapy, in addition to therapies designed to suppress EAD formation
      at the cellular level, may be synergistic in reducing the risk of sudden cardiac 
      death.

AB  - The Arabidopsis thaliana circadian clock is an interconnected network highly
      tractable to systems approaches. Most elements in the
      transcriptional-translational oscillator were identified by genetic means and the
      expression of clock genes in various mutants led to the founding hypothesis of a 
      positive-negative feedback loop being the core clock. The identification of
      additional clock genes beyond those defined in the core led to the use of systems
      approaches to decipher this angiosperm oscillator circuit. Kinetic modeling was
      first used to explain periodicity effects of various circadian mutants. This
      conformed in a flexible way to experimental details. Such observations allowed a 
      recursive use of hypothesis generating from modeling, followed by experimental
      corroboration. More recently, the biochemical finding of new description of a
      DNA-binding activity for one class of clock components directed improvements in
      feature generation, one of which revealed that the core of the oscillator is a
      negative-negative feedback loop. The recursive use of modeling and experimental
      validation has thus revealed many essential transcriptional components that drive
      negative arms in the circadian oscillator. What awaits is to more fully describe 
      the positive arms and an understanding of how additional pathways converge on the
      clock.

TI  - Deterministic versus stochastic models for circadian rhythms.
PG  - 637-53
LID - 10.1023/A:1021286607354 [doi]
AB  - Circadian rhythms which occur with a period close to 24 h in nearly all living
      organisms originate from the negative autoregulation of gene
      expression.Deterministic models based on genetic regulatory processes account for
      theoccurrence of circadian rhythms in constant environmental conditions
      (e.g.constant darkness), for entrainment of these rhythms by light-dark cycles,
      and for their phase-shifting by light pulses. At low numbers of protein and mRNA 
      molecules, it becomes necessary to resort to stochastic simulations to assess the
      influence of molecular noise on circadian oscillations. We address the effect of 
      molecular noise by considering two stochastic versions of a core model for
      circadian rhythms. The deterministic version of this core modelwas previously
      proposed for circadian oscillations of the PER protein in Drosophila and of the
      FRQ protein in Neurospora. In the first, non-developed version of the stochastic 
      model, we introduce molecular noise without decomposing the deterministic
      mechanism into detailed reaction steps while in the second, developed version we 
      carry out such a detailed decomposition. Numerical simulations of the two
      stochastic versions of the model are performed by means of the Gillespie method. 
      We compare the predictions of the deterministic approach with those of the two
      stochastic models, with respect both to sustained oscillations of the limit cycle
      type and to the influence of the proximity of a bifurcation point beyond which
      the system evolves to a stable steady state. The results indicate that robust
      circadian oscillations can occur even when the numbers of mRNA and nuclear
      protein involved in the oscillatory mechanism are reduced to a few tens
      orhundreds, respectively. The non-developed and developed versions of the
      stochastic model yield largely similar results and provide good agreement with
      the predictions of the deterministic model for circadian rhythms.

LID - 10.1098/rsif.2012.0826 [doi]
AB  - The pattern of gene expression in a developing tissue determines the spatial
      organization of cell type generation. We previously defined regulatory
      interactions between a set of transcription factors that specify the pattern of
      gene expression in progenitors of different neuronal subtypes of the vertebrate
      neural tube. These transcription factors form a circuit that acts as a multistate
      switch, patterning the tissue in response to a gradient of Sonic Hedgehog. Here, 
      by simplifying aspects of the regulatory interactions, we found that the topology
      of the circuit allows either switch-like or oscillatory behaviour depending on
      parameter values. The qualitative dynamics appear to be controlled by a simpler
      sub-circuit, which we term the AC-DC motif. We argue that its topology provides a
      natural way to implement a multistate gene expression switch and we show that the
      circuit is readily extendable to produce more distinct stripes of gene
      expression. Our analysis also suggests that AC-DC motifs could be deployed in
      tissues patterned by oscillatory mechanisms, thus blurring the distinction
      between pattern-formation mechanisms relying on temporal oscillations or graded
      signals. Furthermore, during evolution, mechanisms of gradient interpretation
      might have arisen from oscillatory circuits, or vice versa.

TI  - Dynamics of early afterdepolarization-mediated triggered activity in cardiac
      monolayers.
PG  - 2706-14
LID - 10.1016/j.bpj.2012.05.011 [doi]
AB  - Early afterdepolarizations (EADs) are voltage oscillations that occur during the 
      repolarizing phase of the cardiac action potential and cause cardiac arrhythmias 
      in a variety of clinical settings. EADs occur in the setting of reduced
      repolarization reserve and increased inward-over-outward currents, which
      intuitively explains the repolarization delay but does not mechanistically
      explain the time-dependent voltage oscillations that are characteristic of EADs. 
      In a recent theoretical study, we identified a dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation
      as a dynamical mechanism that causes voltage oscillations during EADs, depending 
      on the amplitude and kinetics of the L-type Ca(2+) channel (LTCC) current
      relative to the repolarizing K(+) currents. Here we demonstrate this mechanism
      experimentally. We show that cardiac monolayers exposed to the LTCC agonists
      BayK8644 and isoproterenol produce EAD bursts that are suppressed by the LTCC
      blocker nitrendipine but not by the Na(+) current blocker tetrodoxin, depletion
      of intracellular Ca(2+) stores with thapsigargin and caffeine, or buffering of
      intracellular Ca(2+) with BAPTA-AM. These EAD bursts exhibited a key dynamical
      signature of the dual Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation mechanism, namely, a gradual
      slowing in the frequency of oscillations before burst termination. A detailed
      cardiac action potential model reproduced the experimental observations, and
      identified intracellular Na(+) accumulation as the likely mechanism for
      terminating EAD bursts. Our findings in cardiac monolayers provide direct support
      for the Hopf-homoclinic bifurcation mechanism of EAD-mediated triggered activity,
      and raise the possibility that this mechanism may also contribute to EAD
      formation in clinical settings such as long QT syndromes, heart failure, and
      increased sympathetic output.

TI  - A novel cost function to estimate parameters of oscillatory biochemical systems.
PG  - 3
LID - 10.1186/1687-4153-2012-3 [doi]
AB  - Oscillatory pathways are among the most important classes of biochemical systems 
      with examples ranging from circadian rhythms and cell cycle maintenance.
      Mathematical modeling of these highly interconnected biochemical networks is
      needed to meet numerous objectives such as investigating, predicting and
      controlling the dynamics of these systems. Identifying the kinetic rate
      parameters is essential for fully modeling these and other biological processes. 
      These kinetic parameters, however, are not usually available from measurements
      and most of them have to be estimated by parameter fitting techniques. One of the
      issues with estimating kinetic parameters in oscillatory systems is the
      irregularities in the least square (LS) cost function surface used to estimate
      these parameters, which is caused by the periodicity of the measurements. These
      irregularities result in numerous local minima, which limit the performance of
      even some of the most robust global optimization algorithms. We proposed a
      parameter estimation framework to address these issues that integrates temporal
      information with periodic information embedded in the measurements used to
      estimate these parameters. This periodic information is used to build a proposed 
      cost function with better surface properties leading to fewer local minima and
      better performance of global optimization algorithms. We verified for three
      oscillatory biochemical systems that our proposed cost function results in an
      increased ability to estimate accurate kinetic parameters as compared to the
      traditional LS cost function. We combine this cost function with an improved
      noise removal approach that leverages periodic characteristics embedded in the
      measurements to effectively reduce noise. The results provide strong evidence on 
      the efficacy of this noise removal approach over the previous commonly used
      wavelet hard-thresholding noise removal methods. This proposed optimization
      framework results in more accurate kinetic parameters that will eventually lead
      to biochemical models that are more precise, predictable, and controllable.

      dynamics.
PG  - 918-28

AB  - Arguably, one of the foremost distinctions between life and non-living matter is 
      the ability to sense environmental changes and respond appropriately--an ability 
      that is invested in every living cell. Within a single cell, this function is
      largely carried out by networks of signaling molecules. However, the details of
      how signaling networks help cells make complicated decisions are still not clear.
      For instance, how do cells read graded, analog stress signals but convert them
      into digital live-or-die responses? The answer to such questions may originate
      from the fact that signaling molecules are not static but dynamic entities,
      changing in numbers and activity over time and space. In the past two decades,
      researchers have been able to experimentally monitor signaling dynamics and use
      mathematical techniques to quantify and abstract general principles of how cells 
      process information. In this review, the authors first introduce and discuss
      various experimental and computational methodologies that have been used to study
      signaling dynamics. The authors then discuss the different types of temporal
      dynamics such as oscillations and bistability that can be exhibited by signaling 
      systems and highlight studies that have investigated such dynamics in
      physiological settings. Finally, the authors illustrate the role of spatial
      compartmentalization in regulating cellular responses with examples of
      second-messenger signaling in cardiac myocytes.

TI  - Digital clocks: simple Boolean models can quantitatively describe circadian
      systems.
PG  - 2365-82
LID - 10.1098/rsif.2012.0080 [doi]
AB  - The gene networks that comprise the circadian clock modulate biological function 
      across a range of scales, from gene expression to performance and adaptive
      behaviour. The clock functions by generating endogenous rhythms that can be
      entrained to the external 24-h day-night cycle, enabling organisms to optimally
      time biochemical processes relative to dawn and dusk. In recent years,
      computational models based on differential equations have become useful tools for
      dissecting and quantifying the complex regulatory relationships underlying the
      clock's oscillatory dynamics. However, optimizing the large parameter sets
      characteristic of these models places intense demands on both computational and
      experimental resources, limiting the scope of in silico studies. Here, we develop
      an approach based on Boolean logic that dramatically reduces the parametrization,
      making the state and parameter spaces finite and tractable. We introduce
      efficient methods for fitting Boolean models to molecular data, successfully
      demonstrating their application to synthetic time courses generated by a number
      of established clock models, as well as experimental expression levels measured
      using luciferase imaging. Our results indicate that despite their relative
      simplicity, logic models can (i) simulate circadian oscillations with the
      correct, experimentally observed phase relationships among genes and (ii)
      flexibly entrain to light stimuli, reproducing the complex responses to
      variations in daylength generated by more detailed differential equation
      formulations. Our work also demonstrates that logic models have sufficient
      predictive power to identify optimal regulatory structures from experimental
      data. By presenting the first Boolean models of circadian circuits together with 
      general techniques for their optimization, we hope to establish a new framework
      for the systematic modelling of more complex clocks, as well as other circuits
      with different qualitative dynamics. In particular, we anticipate that the
      ability of logic models to provide a computationally efficient representation of 
      system behaviour could greatly facilitate the reverse-engineering of large-scale 
      biochemical networks.

TI  - Modeling the emergence of circadian rhythms in a clock neuron network.
PG  - e33912
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0033912 [doi]
AB  - Circadian rhythms in pacemaker cells persist for weeks in constant darkness,
      while in other types of cells the molecular oscillations that underlie circadian 
      rhythms damp rapidly under the same conditions. Although much progress has been
      made in understanding the biochemical and cellular basis of circadian rhythms,
      the mechanisms leading to damped or self-sustained oscillations remain largely
      unknown. There exist many mathematical models that reproduce the circadian
      rhythms in the case of a single cell of the Drosophila fly. However, not much is 
      known about the mechanisms leading to coherent circadian oscillation in clock
      neuron networks. In this work we have implemented a model for a network of
      interacting clock neurons to describe the emergence (or damping) of circadian
      rhythms in Drosophila fly, in the absence of zeitgebers. Our model consists of an
      array of pacemakers that interact through the modulation of some parameters by a 
      network feedback. The individual pacemakers are described by a well-known
      biochemical model for circadian oscillation, to which we have added degradation
      of PER protein by light and multiplicative noise. The network feedback is the PER
      protein level averaged over the whole network. In particular, we have
      investigated the effect of modulation of the parameters associated with (i) the
      control of net entrance of PER into the nucleus and (ii) the non-photic
      degradation of PER. Our results indicate that the modulation of PER entrance into
      the nucleus allows the synchronization of clock neurons, leading to coherent
      circadian oscillations under constant dark condition. On the other hand, the
      modulation of non-photic degradation cannot reset the phases of individual clocks
      subjected to intrinsic biochemical noise.

TI  - A symmetric dual feedback system provides a robust and entrainable oscillator.
PG  - e30489
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0030489 [doi]
AB  - Many organisms have evolved molecular clocks to anticipate daily changes in their
      environment. The molecular mechanisms by which the circadian clock network
      produces sustained cycles have extensively been studied and
      transcriptional-translational feedback loops are common structures to many
      organisms. Although a simple or single feedback loop is sufficient for sustained 
      oscillations, circadian clocks implement multiple, complicated feedback loops. In
      general, different types of feedback loops are suggested to affect the robustness
      and entrainment of circadian rhythms. To reveal the mechanism by which such a
      complex feedback system evolves, we quantify the robustness and light entrainment
      of four competing models: the single, semi-dual, dual, and redundant feedback
      models. To extract the global properties of those models, all plausible kinetic
      parameter sets that generate circadian oscillations are searched to characterize 
      their oscillatory features. To efficiently perform such analyses, we used the
      two-phase search (TPS) method as a fast and non-biased search method and
      quasi-multiparameter sensitivity (QMPS) as a fast and exact measure of robustness
      to uncertainty of all kinetic parameters.So far the redundant feedback model has 
      been regarded as the most robust oscillator, but our extensive analysis corrects 
      or overcomes this hypothesis. The dual feedback model, which is employed in
      biology, provides the most robust oscillator to multiple parameter perturbations 
      within a cell and most readily entrains to a wide range of light-dark cycles. The
      kinetic symmetry between the dual loops and their coupling via a protein complex 
      are found critically responsible for robust and entrainable oscillations. We
      first demonstrate how the dual feedback architecture with kinetic symmetry
      evolves out of many competing feedback systems.

TI  - Modeling cortisol dynamics in the neuro-endocrine axis distinguishes normal,
      depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in humans.
PG  - e1002379
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002379 [doi]
AB  - Cortisol, secreted in the adrenal cortex in response to stress, is an informative
      biomarker that distinguishes anxiety disorders such as major depression and
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from normal subjects. Yehuda et al.
      proposed a hypothesis that, in humans, the hypersensitive
      hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is responsible for the occurrence of
      differing levels of cortisol in anxiety disorders. Specifically, PTSD subjects
      have lower cortisol levels during the late subjective night in comparison to
      normal subjects, and this was assumed to occur due to strong negative feedback
      loops in the HPA axis. In the present work, to address this hypothesis, we
      modeled the cortisol dynamics using nonlinear ordinary differential equations and
      estimated the kinetic parameters of the model to fit the experimental data of
      three categories, namely, normal, depressed, and PTSD human subjects. We
      concatenated the subjects (n = 3) in each category and created a model subject (n
      = 1) without considering the patient-to-patient variability in each case. The
      parameters of the model for the three categories were simultaneously obtained
      through global optimization. Bifurcation analysis carried out with the optimized 
      parameters exhibited two supercritical Hopf points and, for the choice of
      parameters, the oscillations were found to be circadian in nature. The fitted
      kinetic parameters indicate that PTSD subjects have a strong negative feedback
      loop and, as a result, the predicted oscillating cortisol levels are extremely
      low at the nadir in contrast to normal subjects, albeit within the endocrinologic
      range. We also simulated the phenotypes for each of the categories and, as
      observed in the clinical data of PTSD patients, the simulated cortisol levels are
      consistently low at the nadir, and correspondingly the negative feedback was
      found to be extremely strong. These results from the model support the hypothesis
      that high stress intensity and strong negative feedback loop may cause
      hypersensitive neuro-endocrine axis that results in hypocortisolemia in PTSD.

LID - 10.1016/j.bpj.2011.10.008 [doi]
AB  - Circadian rhythms are governed by a highly coupled, complex network of genes. Due
      to feedback within the network, any modification of the system's state requires
      coherent changes in several nodes. A model of the underlying network is necessary
      to compute these modifications. We use an effective modeling approach for this
      task. Rather than inferred biochemical interactions, our method utilizes
      microarray data from a group of mutants for its construction. With simulated
      data, we develop an effective model for a circadian network in a peripheral
      tissue, subject to driving by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the mammalian
      pacemaker. The effective network can predict time-dependent gene expression
      levels in other mutants.

AB  - Negative and positive transcriptional feedback loops are present in natural and
      synthetic genetic oscillators. A single gene with negative transcriptional
      feedback needs a time delay and sufficiently strong nonlinearity in the
      transmission of the feedback signal in order to produce biochemical rhythms. A
      single gene with only positive transcriptional feedback does not produce
      oscillations. Here, we demonstrate that this single-gene network in conjunction
      with a simple negative interaction can also easily produce rhythms. We examine a 
      model comprised of two well-differentiated parts. The first is a positive
      feedback created by a protein that binds to the promoter of its own gene and
      activates the transcription. The second is a negative interaction in which a
      repressor molecule prevents this protein from binding to its promoter. A
      stochastic study shows that the system is robust to noise. A deterministic study 
      identifies that the dynamics of the oscillator are mainly driven by two types of 
      biomolecules: the protein, and the complex formed by the repressor and this
      protein. The main conclusion of this paper is that a simple and usual negative
      interaction, such as degradation, sequestration or inhibition, acting on the
      positive transcriptional feedback of a single gene is a sufficient condition to
      produce reliable oscillations. One gene is enough and the positive
      transcriptional feedback signal does not need to activate a second repressor
      gene. This means that at the genetic level an explicit negative feedback loop is 
      not necessary. The model needs neither cooperative binding reactions nor the
      formation of protein multimers. Therefore, our findings could help to clarify the
      design principles of cellular clocks and constitute a new efficient tool for
      engineering synthetic genetic oscillators.

TI  - Multi-scale modeling in biology: how to bridge the gaps between scales?
PG  - 21-31
LID - 10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2011.06.004 [doi]
AB  - Human physiological functions are regulated across many orders of magnitude in
      space and time. Integrating the information and dynamics from one scale to
      another is critical for the understanding of human physiology and the treatment
      of diseases. Multi-scale modeling, as a computational approach, has been widely
      adopted by researchers in computational and systems biology. A key unsolved issue
      is how to represent appropriately the dynamical behaviors of a high-dimensional
      model of a lower scale by a low-dimensional model of a higher scale, so that it
      can be used to investigate complex dynamical behaviors at even higher scales of
      integration. In the article, we first review the widely-used different modeling
      methodologies and their applications at different scales. We then discuss the
      gaps between different modeling methodologies and between scales, and discuss
      potential methods for bridging the gaps between scales.

TI  - Michaelis-Menten speeds up tau-leaping under a wide range of conditions.
PG  - 134112
LID - 10.1063/1.3576123 [doi]
AB  - This paper examines the benefits of Michaelis-Menten model reduction techniques
      in stochastic tau-leaping simulations. Results show that although the conditions 
      for the validity of the reductions for tau-leaping remain the same as those for
      the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), the reductions result in a substantial
      speed-up for tau-leaping under a different range of conditions than they do for
      SSA. The reason of this discrepancy is that the time steps for SSA and for
      tau-leaping are determined by different properties of system dynamics.

TI  - A dynamic model for functional mapping of biological rhythms.
PG  - 84-101
LID - 10.1080/17513758.2010.491558 [doi]
AB  - Functional mapping is a statistical method for mapping quantitative trait loci
      (QTLs) that regulate the dynamic pattern of a biological trait. This method
      integrates mathematical aspects of biological complexity into a mixture model for
      genetic mapping and tests the genetic effects of QTLs by comparing
      genotype-specific curve parameters. As a way of quantitatively specifying the
      dynamic behavior of a system, differential equations have proven to be powerful
      for modeling and unraveling the biochemical, molecular, and cellular mechanisms
      of a biological process, such as biological rhythms. The equipment of functional 
      mapping with biologically meaningful differential equations provides new insights
      into the genetic control of any dynamic processes. We formulate a new functional 
      mapping framework for a dynamic biological rhythm by incorporating a group of
      ordinary differential equations (ODE). The Runge-Kutta fourth order algorithm was
      implemented to estimate the parameters that define the system of ODE. The new
      model will find its implications for understanding the interplay between gene
      interactions and developmental pathways in complex biological rhythms.

TI  - Phase-locked signals elucidate circuit architecture of an oscillatory pathway.
PG  - e1001040
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001040 [doi]
AB  - This paper introduces the concept of phase-locking analysis of oscillatory
      cellular signaling systems to elucidate biochemical circuit architecture.
      Phase-locking is a physical phenomenon that refers to a response mode in which
      system output is synchronized to a periodic stimulus; in some instances, the
      number of responses can be fewer than the number of inputs, indicative of skipped
      beats. While the observation of phase-locking alone is largely independent of
      detailed mechanism, we find that the properties of phase-locking are useful for
      discriminating circuit architectures because they reflect not only the activation
      but also the recovery characteristics of biochemical circuits. Here, this
      principle is demonstrated for analysis of a G-protein coupled receptor system,
      the M3 muscarinic receptor-calcium signaling pathway, using microfluidic-mediated
      periodic chemical stimulation of the M3 receptor with carbachol and real-time
      imaging of resulting calcium transients. Using this approach we uncovered the
      potential importance of basal IP3 production, a finding that has important
      implications on calcium response fidelity to periodic stimulation. Based upon our
      analysis, we also negated the notion that the Gq-PLC interaction is switch-like, 
      which has a strong influence upon how extracellular signals are filtered and
      interpreted downstream. Phase-locking analysis is a new and useful tool for model
      revision and mechanism elucidation; the method complements conventional genetic
      and chemical tools for analysis of cellular signaling circuitry and should be
      broadly applicable to other oscillatory pathways.

TI  - Robustness of circadian clocks to daylight fluctuations: hints from the
      picoeucaryote Ostreococcus tauri.
PG  - e1000990
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000990 [doi]
AB  - The development of systemic approaches in biology has put emphasis on identifying
      genetic modules whose behavior can be modeled accurately so as to gain insight
      into their structure and function. However, most gene circuits in a cell are
      under control of external signals and thus, quantitative agreement between
      experimental data and a mathematical model is difficult. Circadian biology has
      been one notable exception: quantitative models of the internal clock that
      orchestrates biological processes over the 24-hour diurnal cycle have been
      constructed for a few organisms, from cyanobacteria to plants and mammals. In
      most cases, a complex architecture with interlocked feedback loops has been
      evidenced. Here we present the first modeling results for the circadian clock of 
      the green unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri. Two plant-like clock genes have
      been shown to play a central role in the Ostreococcus clock. We find that their
      expression time profiles can be accurately reproduced by a minimal model of a
      two-gene transcriptional feedback loop. Remarkably, best adjustment of data
      recorded under light/dark alternation is obtained when assuming that the
      oscillator is not coupled to the diurnal cycle. This suggests that coupling to
      light is confined to specific time intervals and has no dynamical effect when the
      oscillator is entrained by the diurnal cycle. This intriguing property may
      reflect a strategy to minimize the impact of fluctuations in daylight intensity
      on the core circadian oscillator, a type of perturbation that has been rarely
      considered when assessing the robustness of circadian clocks.

AB  - The field of systems biology studies how the interactions among individual

      circadian (daily) timekeeping system in mammals is an ideal system to study
      complexity because of its many biological scales (from genes to animal behavior).
      A wealth of data at each of these scales has recently been discovered. Within
      each scale, modeling can advance our understanding of challenging problems that
      arise in studying mammalian timekeeping. However, future work must focus on
      bridging the multiple spatial and temporal scales in the modeling of SCN network.
      Here we review recent advances, and then delve into a few areas that are
      promising research directions. We also discuss the flavor of modeling needed
      (simple or detailed) as well as new techniques that are needed to meet the
      challenges in modeling data across scales.

TI  - A graphical method for reducing and relating models in systems biology.
PG  - i575-81
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btq388 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: In Systems Biology, an increasing collection of models of various
      biological processes is currently developed and made available in publicly
      accessible repositories, such as biomodels.net for instance, through common
      exchange formats such as SBML. To date, however, there is no general method to
      relate different models to each other by abstraction or reduction relationships, 
      and this task is left to the modeler for re-using and coupling models. In
      mathematical biology, model reduction techniques have been studied for a long
      time, mainly in the case where a model exhibits different time scales, or
      different spatial phases, which can be analyzed separately. These techniques are 
      however far too restrictive to be applied on a large scale in systems biology,
      and do not take into account abstractions other than time or phase
      decompositions. Our purpose here is to propose a general computational method for
      relating models together, by considering primarily the structure of the
      interactions and abstracting from their dynamics in a first step. RESULTS: We
      present a graph-theoretic formalism with node merge and delete operations, in
      which model reductions can be studied as graph matching problems. From this
      setting, we derive an algorithm for deciding whether there exists a reduction
      from one model to another, and evaluate it on the computation of the reduction
      relations between all SBML models of the biomodels.net repository. In particular,
      in the case of the numerous models of MAPK signalling, and of the circadian
      clock, biologically meaningful mappings between models of each class are
      automatically inferred from the structure of the interactions. We conclude on the
      generality of our graphical method, on its limits with respect to the
      representation of the structure of the interactions in SBML, and on some
      perspectives for dealing with the dynamics. AVAILABILITY: The algorithms
      described in this article are implemented in the open-source software modeling
      platform BIOCHAM available at http://contraintes.inria.fr/biocham The models used
      in the experiments are available from http://www.biomodels.net/.

TI  - Conditions for Global Stability of Monotone Tridiagonal Systems with Negative
      Feedback.
PG  - 130-138
AB  - This paper studies monotone tridiagonal systems with negative feedback. These
      systems possess the Poincare-Bendixson property, which implies that, if orbits
      are bounded, if there is a unique steady state and this unique steady state is
      asymptotically stable, and if one can rule out periodic orbits, then the steady
      state is globally asymptotically stable. Two different approaches are discussed
      to rule out period orbits, one based on direct linearization and another one
      based on the theory of second additive compound matrices. Among the examples that
      illustrate the theoretical results is the classical Goldbeter model of the
      circadian rhythm.

      Pathways.
LID - 10.1155/2010/783273 [doi]
LID - 783273 [pii]
AB  - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR alpha, beta/delta and gamma)
      play a key role in metabolic regulatory processes and gene regulation of cellular
      metabolism, particularly in the cardiovascular system. Moreover, PPARs have
      various extra metabolic roles, in circadian rhythms, inflammation and oxidative
      stress. In this review, we focus mainly on the effects of PPARs on some
      thermodynamic processes, which can behave either near equilibrium, or
      far-from-equilibrium. New functions of PPARs are reported in the arrhythmogenic
      right ventricular cardiomyopathy, a human genetic heart disease. It is now
      possible to link the genetic desmosomal abnormalitiy to the presence of fat in
      the right ventricle, partly due to an overexpression of PPARgamma. Moreover,
      PPARs are directly or indirectly involved in cellular oscillatory processes such 
      as the Wnt-b-catenin pathway, circadian rhythms of arterial blood pressure and
      cardiac frequency and glycolysis metabolic pathway. Dysfunction of clock genes
      and PPARgamma may lead to hyperphagia, obesity, metabolic syndrome, myocardial
      infarction and sudden cardiac death, In pathological conditions, regulatory
      processes of the cardiovascular system may bifurcate towards new states, such as 
      those encountered in hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and heart failure. Numerous
      of these oscillatory mechanisms, organized in time and space, behave far from
      equilibrium and are "dissipative structures".

TI  - Reliability of transcriptional cycles and the yeast cell-cycle oscillator.
PG  - e1000842
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000842 [doi]
AB  - A recently published transcriptional oscillator associated with the yeast cell
      cycle provides clues and raises questions about the mechanisms underlying
      autonomous cyclic processes in cells. Unlike other biological and synthetic
      oscillatory networks in the literature, this one does not seem to rely on a
      constitutive signal or positive auto-regulation, but rather to operate through
      stable transmission of a pulse on a slow positive feedback loop that determines
      its period. We construct a continuous-time Boolean model of this network, which
      permits the modeling of noise through small fluctuations in the timing of events,
      and show that it can sustain stable oscillations. Analysis of simpler network
      models shows how a few building blocks can be arranged to provide stability
      against fluctuations. Our findings suggest that the transcriptional oscillator in
      yeast belongs to a new class of biological oscillators.

TI  - Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave
      transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system.
PG  - e1000394
LID - 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 [doi]
AB  - Cyanobacteria are the only model circadian clock system in which a circadian
      oscillator can be reconstituted in vitro. The underlying circadian mechanism
      appears to comprise two subcomponents: a post-translational oscillator (PTO) and 
      a transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TTFL). The PTO and TTFL have been 
      hypothesized to operate as dual oscillator systems in cyanobacteria. However, we 
      find that they have a definite hierarchical interdependency-the PTO is the core
      pacemaker while the TTFL is a slave oscillator that quickly damps when the PTO
      stops. By analysis of overexpression experiments and mutant clock proteins, we
      find that the circadian system is dependent upon the PTO and that suppression of 
      the PTO leads to damped TTFL-based oscillations whose temperature compensation is
      not stable under different metabolic conditions. Mathematical modeling indicates 
      that the experimental data are compatible with a core PTO driving the TTFL; the
      combined PTO/TTFL system is resilient to noise. Moreover, the modeling indicates 
      a mechanism by which the TTFL can feed into the PTO such that new synthesis of
      clock proteins can phase-shift or entrain the core PTO pacemaker. This prediction
      was experimentally tested and confirmed by entraining the in vivo circadian
      system with cycles of new clock protein synthesis that modulate the
      phosphorylation status of the clock proteins in the PTO. In cyanobacteria, the
      PTO is the self-sustained core pacemaker that can operate independently of the
      TTFL, but the TTFL damps when the phosphorylation status of the PTO is clamped.
      However, the TTFL can provide entraining input into the PTO. This study is the
      first to our knowledge to experimentally and theoretically investigate the
      dynamics of a circadian clock in which a PTO is coupled to a TTFL. These results 
      have important implications for eukaryotic clock systems in that they can explain
      how a TTFL could appear to be a core circadian clockwork when in fact the true
      pacemaker is an embedded biochemical oscillator.

AB  - Many organisms display rhythms of physiology and behavior that are entrained to
      the 24-h cycle of light and darkness prevailing on Earth. Under constant
      conditions of illumination and temperature, these internal biological rhythms
      persist with a period close to 1 day ("circadian"), but it is usually not exactly
      24h. Recent discoveries have uncovered stunning similarities among the molecular 
      circuitries of circadian clocks in mice, fruit flies, and bread molds. A
      consensus picture is coming into focus around two proteins (called PER and TIM in
      fruit flies), which dimerize and then inhibit transcription of their own genes.
      Although this picture seems to confirm a venerable model of circadian rhythms
      based on time-delayed negative feedback, we suggest that just as crucial to the
      circadian oscillator is a positive feedback loop based on stabilization of PER
      upon dimerization. These ideas can be expressed in simple mathematical form
      (phase plane portraits), and the model accounts naturally for several hallmarks
      of circadian rhythms, including temperature compensation and the per(L) mutant
      phenotype. In addition, the model suggests how an endogenous circadian oscillator
      could have evolved from a more primitive, light-activated switch.

TI  - Avoiding transcription factor competition at promoter level increases the chances
      of obtaining oscillation.
PG  - 66
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-4-66 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ultimate goal of synthetic biology is the conception and
      construction of genetic circuits that are reliable with respect to their designed
      function (e.g. oscillators, switches). This task remains still to be attained due
      to the inherent synergy of the biological building blocks and to an insufficient 
      feedback between experiments and mathematical models. Nevertheless, the progress 
      in these directions has been substantial. RESULTS: It has been emphasized in the 
      literature that the architecture of a genetic oscillator must include positive
      (activating) and negative (inhibiting) genetic interactions in order to yield
      robust oscillations. Our results point out that the oscillatory capacity is not
      only affected by the interaction polarity but by how it is implemented at
      promoter level. For a chosen oscillator architecture, we show by means of
      numerical simulations that the existence or lack of competition between activator
      and inhibitor at promoter level affects the probability of producing oscillations
      and also leaves characteristic fingerprints on the associated period/amplitude
      features. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with non-competitive binding at promoters,
      competition drastically reduces the region of the parameters space characterized 
      by oscillatory solutions. Moreover, while competition leads to pulse-like
      oscillations with long-tail distribution in period and amplitude for various
      parameters or noisy conditions, the non-competitive scenario shows a
      characteristic frequency and confined amplitude values. Our study also situates
      the competition mechanism in the context of existing genetic oscillators, with
      emphasis on the Atkinson oscillator.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A great deal of data has accumulated on signalling pathways. These
      large datasets are thought to contain much implicit information on their
      molecular structure, interaction and activity information, which provides a
      picture of intricate molecular networks believed to underlie biological
      functions. While tremendous advances have been made in trying to understand these
      systems, how information is transmitted within them is still poorly understood.
      This ever growing amount of data demands we adopt powerful computational
      techniques that will play a pivotal role in the conversion of mined data to
      knowledge, and in elucidating the topological and functional properties of
      protein - protein interactions. RESULTS: A computational framework is presented
      which allows for the description of embedded networks, and identification of
      common shared components thought to assist in the transmission of information
      within the systems studied. By employing the graph theories of network biology - 
      such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, vertex betweenness and
      shortest path measures - topological features of protein-protein interactions for
      published datasets of the p53, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and G1/S phase 
      of the cell cycle systems were ascertained. Highly ranked nodes which in some
      cases were identified as connecting proteins most likely responsible for
      propagation of transduction signals across the networks were determined. The
      functional consequences of these nodes in the context of their network
      environment were also determined. These findings highlight the usefulness of the 
      framework in identifying possible combination or links as targets for therapeutic
      responses; and put forward the idea of using retrieved knowledge on the shared
      components in constructing better organised and structured models of signalling
      networks. CONCLUSION: It is hoped that through the data mined reconstructed
      signal transduction networks, well developed models of the published data can be 
      built which in the end would guide the prediction of new targets based on the
      pathway's environment for further analysis. Source code is available upon

PG  - 2399-408

AB  - Eukaryotic circadian clocks include interconnected positive and negative feedback
      loops. The clock-cycle dimer (CLK-CYC) and its homolog, CLK-BMAL1, are key
      transcriptional activators of central components of the Drosophila and mammalian 
      circadian networks, respectively. In Drosophila, negative loops include
      period-timeless and vrille; positive loops include par domain protein 1.
      Clockwork orange (CWO) is a recently discovered negative transcription factor
      with unusual effects on period, timeless, vrille, and par domain protein 1. To
      understand the actions of this protein, we introduced a new system of ordinary
      differential equations to model regulatory networks. The model is faithful in the
      sense that it replicates biological observations. CWO loop actions elevate
      CLK-CYC; the transcription of direct targets responds by integrating opposing
      signals from CWO and CLK-CYC. Loop regulation and integration of opposite
      transcriptional signals appear to be central mechanisms as they also explain
      paradoxical effects of period gain-of-function and null mutations.

TI  - Stochastic simulation of delay-induced circadian rhythms in Drosophila.
PG  - 386853
LID - 10.1155/2009/386853 [doi]
AB  - Circadian rhythms are ubiquitous in all eukaryotes and some prokaryotes. Several 
      computational models with or without time delays have been developed for
      circadian rhythms. Exact stochastic simulations have been carried out for several
      models without time delays, but no exact stochastic simulation has been done for 
      models with delays. In this paper, we proposed a detailed and a reduced
      stochastic model with delays for circadian rhythms in Drosophila based on two
      deterministic models of Smolen et al. and employed exact stochastic simulation to
      simulate circadian oscillations. Our simulations showed that both models can
      produce sustained oscillations and that the oscillation is robust to noise in the
      sense that there is very little variability in oscillation period although there 
      are significant random fluctuations in oscillation peaks. Moreover, although
      average time delays are essential to simulation of oscillation, random changes in
      time delays within certain range around fixed average time delay cause little
      variability in the oscillation period. Our simulation results also showed that
      both models are robust to parameter variations and that oscillation can be
      entrained by light/dark circles. Our simulations further demonstrated that within
      a reasonable range around the experimental result, the rates that dclock and per 
      promoters switch back and forth between activated and repressed sites have little
      impact on oscillation period.

TI  - On the functional diversity of dynamical behaviour in genetic and metabolic
      feedback systems.
PG  - 51
LID - 10.1186/1752-0509-3-51 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Feedback regulation plays crucial roles in the robust control and
      maintenance of many cellular systems. Negative feedbacks are found to underline
      both stable and unstable, often oscillatory, behaviours. We explore the dynamical
      characteristics of systems with single as well as coupled negative feedback loops
      using a combined approach of analytical and numerical techniques. Particularly,
      we emphasise how the loop's characterising factors (strength and cooperativity
      levels) affect system dynamics and how individual loops interact in the
      coupled-loop systems. RESULTS: We develop an analytical bifurcation analysis
      based on the stability and the Routh-Hurwitz theorem for a common negative
      feedback system and a variety of its variants. We demonstrate that different
      combinations of the feedback strengths of individual loops give rise to different
      dynamical behaviours. Moreover, incorporating more negative feedback loops always
      tend to enhance system stability. We show that two mechanisms, in addition to the
      lengthening of pathway, can lower the Hill coefficient to a biologically
      plausible level required for sustained oscillations. These include loops coupling
      and end-product utilisation. We find that the degradation rates solely affect the
      threshold Hill coefficient for sustained oscillation, while the synthesis rates
      have more significant roles in determining the threshold feedback strength.
      Unbalancing the degradation rates between the system species is found as a way to
      improve stability. CONCLUSION: The analytical methods and insights presented in
      this study demonstrate that reallocation of the feedback loop may or may not make
      the system more stable; the specific effect is determined by the degradation
      rates of the newly inhibited molecular species. As the loop moves closer to the
      end of the pathway, the minimum Hill coefficient for oscillation is reduced.
      Furthermore, under general (unequal) values of the degradation rates, system
      extension becomes more stable only when the added species degrades slower than it
      is being produced; otherwise the system is more prone to oscillation. The
      coupling of loops significantly increases the richness of dynamical bifurcation
      characteristics. The likelihood of having oscillatory behaviour is directly
      determined by the loops' strength: stronger loops always result in smaller
      oscillatory regions.

PG  - 59-87
LID - 10.1007/s11693-007-9005-9 [doi]
AB  - Monotone subsystems have appealing properties as components of larger networks,
      since they exhibit robust dynamical stability and predictability of responses to 
      perturbations. This suggests that natural biological systems may have evolved to 
      be, if not monotone, at least close to monotone in the sense of being
      decomposable into a "small" number of monotone components, In addition, recent
      research has shown that much insight can be attained from decomposing networks
      into monotone subsystems and the analysis of the resulting interconnections using
      tools from control theory. This paper provides an expository introduction to
      monotone systems and their interconnections, describing the basic concepts and
      some of the main mathematical results in a largely informal fashion.

AB  - Cellular rhythms are generated by complex interactions among genes, proteins and 
      metabolites. They are used to control every aspect of cell physiology, from
      signalling, motility and development to growth, division and death. We consider
      specific examples of oscillatory processes and discuss four general requirements 
      for biochemical oscillations: negative feedback, time delay, sufficient
      'nonlinearity' of the reaction kinetics and proper balancing of the timescales of
      opposing chemical reactions. Positive feedback is one mechanism to delay the
      negative-feedback signal. Biological oscillators can be classified according to
      the topology of the positive- and negative-feedback loops in the underlying
      regulatory mechanism.

PG  - 2884-93
LID - 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2008.00483.x [doi]
AB  - Enzyme isoforms are found in many cellular reactions, and can differ in the kind 
      of reaction they catalyze, in their substrate affinity, or in their reaction
      rates. The evolutionary significance of enzyme isoforms is only partially
      understood. We used mathematical modeling to investigate the hypothesis that
      isoforms may be favored by selection because they can increase the phenotypic
      robustness of the system. We modify a model for circadian clock gene expression
      in Drosophila to incorporate the presence of isoforms in the phosphorylation
      pathway of the period gene. We consider the case in which different isoforms
      catalyze the same reaction but have different affinities for the substrate.
      Stability is increased if there is dynamic control of the expression of isoforms 
      relative to each other. Thus, we show that controlling isoform proportion can be 
      a powerful mechanism for reducing the effects of variations in the values of
      system parameters, increasing system robustness.

AB  - To introduce this special issue on biological switches and clocks, we review the 
      historical development of mathematical models of bistability and oscillations in 
      chemical reaction networks. In the 1960s and 1970s, these models were limited to 
      well-studied biochemical examples, such as glycolytic oscillations and cyclic AMP
      signalling. After the molecular genetics revolution of the 1980s, the field of
      molecular cell biology was thrown wide open to mathematical modellers. We review 
      recent advances in modelling the gene-protein interaction networks that control
      circadian rhythms, cell cycle progression, signal processing and the design of
      synthetic gene networks.

TI  - The Per2 negative feedback loop sets the period in the mammalian circadian clock 
      mechanism.
PG  - e242
AB  - Processes that repeat in time, such as the cell cycle, the circadian rhythm, and 
      seasonal variations, are prevalent in biology. Mathematical models can represent 
      our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms, and numerical methods can then
      facilitate analysis, which forms the foundation for a more integrated
      understanding as well as for design and intervention. Here, the intracellular
      molecular network responsible for the mammalian circadian clock system was
      studied. A new formulation of detailed sensitivity analysis is introduced and
      applied to elucidate the influence of individual rate processes, represented
      through their parameters, on network functional characteristics. One of four
      negative feedback loops in the model, the Per2 loop, was uniquely identified as
      most responsible for setting the period of oscillation; none of the other
      feedback loops were found to play as substantial a role. The analysis further
      suggested that the activity of the kinases CK1delta and CK1varepsilon were well
      placed within the network such that they could be instrumental in implementing
      short-term adjustments to the period in the circadian clock system. The numerical
      results reported here are supported by previously published experimental data.

TI  - Stochastic synchronization of genetic oscillator networks.
PG  - 6
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study of synchronization among genetic oscillators is essential
      for the understanding of the rhythmic phenomena of living organisms at both
      molecular and cellular levels. Genetic networks are intrinsically noisy due to
      natural random intra- and inter-cellular fluctuations. Therefore, it is important
      to study the effects of noise perturbation on the synchronous dynamics of genetic
      oscillators. From the synthetic biology viewpoint, it is also important to
      implement biological systems that minimizing the negative influence of the
      perturbations. RESULTS: In this paper, based on systems biology approach, we
      provide a general theoretical result on the synchronization of genetic
      oscillators with stochastic perturbations. By exploiting the specific properties 
      of many genetic oscillator models, we provide an easy-verified sufficient
      condition for the stochastic synchronization of coupled genetic oscillators,
      based on the Lur'e system approach in control theory. A design principle for
      minimizing the influence of noise is also presented. To demonstrate the
      effectiveness of our theoretical results, a population of coupled repressillators
      is adopted as a numerical example. CONCLUSION: In summary, we present an
      efficient theoretical method for analyzing the synchronization of genetic
      oscillator networks, which is helpful for understanding and testing the
      synchronization phenomena in biological organisms. Besides, the results are
      actually applicable to general oscillator networks.

TI  - A molecular model for intercellular synchronization in the mammalian circadian
      clock.
PG  - 3792-803
AB  - The mechanisms and consequences of synchrony among heterogeneous oscillators are 
      poorly understood in biological systems. We present a multicellular, molecular
      model of the mammalian circadian clock that incorporates recent data implicating 
      the neurotransmitter vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) as the key
      synchronizing agent. The model postulates that synchrony arises among circadian
      neurons because they release VIP rhythmically on a daily basis and in response to
      ambient light. Two basic cell types, intrinsically rhythmic pacemakers and damped
      oscillators, are assumed to arise from a distribution of Period gene
      transcription rates. Postsynaptic neurons show time-of-day dependent responses to
      VIP binding through a signaling cascade that activates Period mRNA transcription.
      The heterogeneous cell ensemble model self-synchronizes, entrains to ambient
      light-dark cycles, and desynchronizes in constant bright light or upon removal of
      VIP signaling. The degree of synchronicity observed depends on cell-specific
      features (e.g., mean and variability of parameters within the rhythm-generating
      loop), in addition to the more commonly studied effect of intercellular coupling 
      strength. These simulations closely replicate experimental data and predict that 
      heterogeneous oscillations (e.g., sustained, damped, and arrhythmic) arise from
      small differences in the molecular parameters between cells, that damped
      oscillators participate in entrainment and synchrony of the ensemble of cells,
      and that constant light desynchronizes oscillators by maximizing VIP release.

TI  - Robustness can evolve gradually in complex regulatory gene networks with varying 
      topology.
PG  - e15
AB  - The topology of cellular circuits (the who-interacts-with-whom) is key to
      understand their robustness to both mutations and noise. The reason is that many 
      biochemical parameters driving circuit behavior vary extensively and are thus not
      fine-tuned. Existing work in this area asks to what extent the function of any
      one given circuit is robust. But is high robustness truly remarkable, or would it
      be expected for many circuits of similar topology? And how can high robustness
      come about through gradual Darwinian evolution that changes circuit topology
      gradually, one interaction at a time? We here ask these questions for a model of 
      transcriptional regulation networks, in which we explore millions of different
      network topologies. Robustness to mutations and noise are correlated in these
      networks. They show a skewed distribution, with a very small number of networks
      being vastly more robust than the rest. All networks that attain a given gene
      expression state can be organized into a graph whose nodes are networks that
      differ in their topology. Remarkably, this graph is connected and can be easily
      traversed by gradual changes of network topologies. Thus, robustness is an
      evolvable property. This connectedness and evolvability of robust networks may be
      a general organizational principle of biological networks. In addition, it exists
      also for RNA and protein structures, and may thus be a general organizational
      principle of all biological systems.

TI  - A computational model for functional mapping of genes that regulate
      intra-cellular circadian rhythms.
PG  - 5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genes that control circadian rhythms in organisms have been
      recognized, but have been difficult to detect because circadian behavior
      comprises periodically dynamic traits and is sensitive to environmental changes. 
      METHOD: We present a statistical model for mapping and characterizing specific
      genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affect variations in rhythmic
      responses. This model integrates a system of differential equations into the
      framework for functional mapping, allowing hypotheses about the interplay between
      genetic actions and periodic rhythms to be tested. A simulation approach based on
      sustained circadian oscillations of the clock proteins and their mRNAs has been
      designed to test the statistical properties of the model. CONCLUSION: The model
      has significant implications for probing the molecular genetic mechanism of
      rhythmic oscillations through the detection of the clock QTL throughout the
      genome.

TI  - Gates and oscillators II: zeitgebers and the network model of the brain clock.
PG  - 14-25
AB  - Circadian rhythms in physiology and behavior are regulated by the SCN. When
      assessed by expression of clock genes, at least 2 distinct functional cell types 
      are discernible within the SCN: nonrhythmic, light-inducible, retinorecipient
      cells and rhythmic autonomous oscillator cells that are not directly
      retinorecipient. To predict the responses of the circadian system, the authors
      have proposed a model based on these biological properties. In this model, output
      of rhythmic oscillator cells regulates the activity of the gate cells. The gate
      cells provide a daily organizing signal that maintains phase coherence among the 
      oscillator cells. In the absence of external stimuli, this arrangement yields a
      multicomponent system capable of producing a self-sustained consensus rhythm.
      This follow-up study considers how the system responds when the gate cells are
      activated by an external stimulus, simulating a response to an entraining (or
      phase-setting) signal. In this model, the authors find that the system can be
      entrained to periods within the circadian range, that the free-running system can
      be phase shifted by timed activation of the gate, and that the phase response
      curve for activation is similar to that observed when animals are exposed to a
      light pulse. Finally, exogenous triggering of the gate over a number of days can 
      organize an arrhythmic system, simulating the light-dependent reappearance of
      rhythmicity in a population of disorganized, independent oscillators. The model
      demonstrates that a single mechanism (i.e., the output of gate cells) can account
      for not only free-running and entrained rhythmicity but also other circadian
      phenomena, including limits of entrainment, a PRC with both delay and advance
      zones, and the light-dependent reappearance of rhythmicity in an arrhythmic
      animal.

TI  - A proposal for robust temperature compensation of circadian rhythms.
PG  - 1195-200
AB  - The internal circadian rhythms of cells and organisms coordinate their
      physiological properties to the prevailing 24-h cycle of light and dark on earth.
      The mechanisms generating circadian rhythms have four defining characteristics:
      they oscillate endogenously with period close to 24 h, entrain to external
      signals, suffer phase shifts by aberrant pulses of light or temperature, and
      compensate for changes in temperature over a range of 10 degrees C or more. Most 
      theoretical descriptions of circadian rhythms propose that the underlying
      mechanism generates a stable limit cycle oscillation (in constant darkness or dim
      light), because limit cycles quite naturally possess the first three defining
      properties of circadian rhythms. On the other hand, the period of a limit cycle
      oscillator is typically very sensitive to kinetic rate constants, which increase 
      markedly with temperature. Temperature compensation is therefore not a general
      property of limit cycle oscillations but must be imposed by some delicate balance
      of temperature dependent effects. However, "delicate balances" are unlikely to be
      robust to mutations. On the other hand, if circadian rhythms arise from a
      mechanism that concentrates sensitivity into a few rate constants, then the
      "balancing act" is likely to be more robust and evolvable. We propose a
      switch-like mechanism for circadian rhythms that concentrates period sensitivity 
      in just two parameters, by forcing the system to alternate between a stable
      steady state and a stable limit cycle.

TI  - Transient resetting: a novel mechanism for synchrony and its biological examples.
PG  - e103
AB  - The study of synchronization in biological systems is essential for the
      understanding of the rhythmic phenomena of living organisms at both molecular and
      cellular levels. In this paper, by using simple dynamical systems theory, we
      present a novel mechanism, named transient resetting, for the synchronization of 
      uncoupled biological oscillators with stimuli. This mechanism not only can unify 
      and extend many existing results on (deterministic and stochastic)
      stimulus-induced synchrony, but also may actually play an important role in
      biological rhythms. We argue that transient resetting is a possible mechanism for
      the synchronization in many biological organisms, which might also be further
      used in the medical therapy of rhythmic disorders. Examples of the
      synchronization of neural and circadian oscillators as well as a chaotic neuron

TI  - A model for the circadian rhythm of cyanobacteria that maintains oscillation
      without gene expression.
PG  - 2015-23
AB  - An intriguing property of the cyanobacterial circadian clock is that endogenous
      rhythm persists when protein abundances are kept constant either in the presence 
      of translation and transcription inhibitors or in the constant dark condition.
      Here we propose a regulatory mechanism of KaiC phosphorylation for the generation
      of circadian oscillations in cyanobacteria. In the model, clock proteins KaiA and
      KaiB are assumed to have multiple states, regulating the KaiC phosphorylation
      process. The model can explain 1), the sustained oscillation of gene expression
      and protein abundance when the expression of the kaiBC gene is regulated by KaiC 
      protein, and 2), the sustained oscillation of phosphorylated KaiC when
      transcription and translation processes are inhibited and total protein abundance
      is fixed. Results of this work suggest that KaiA and KaiB strengthen the
      nonlinearity of KaiC phosphorylation, thereby promoting the circadian rhythm in
      cyanobacteria.

TI  - Circuit topology and the evolution of robustness in two-gene circadian
      oscillators.
PG  - 11775-80
AB  - Many parameters driving the behavior of biochemical circuits vary extensively and
      are thus not fine-tuned. Therefore, the topology of such circuits (the
      who-interacts-with-whom) is key to understanding their central properties. I here
      explore several hundred different topologies of a simple biochemical model of
      circadian oscillations to ask two questions: Do different circuits differ
      dramatically in their robustness to parameter change? If so, can a process of
      gradual molecular evolution find highly robust topologies when starting from less
      robust topologies? I find that the distribution of robustness among different
      circuit topologies is highly skewed: Most show low robustness, whereas very few
      topologies are highly robust. To address the second evolutionary question, I
      define a topology graph, each of whose nodes corresponds to one circuit topology 
      that shows circadian oscillations. Two nodes in this graph are connected if they 
      differ by only one regulatory interaction within the circuit. For the circadian
      oscillator I study, most topologies are connected in this graph, making
      evolutionary transitions from low to high robustness easy. A similar approach has
      been used to study the evolution of robustness in biological macromolecules, with
      similar results. This suggests that the same principles govern the evolution of
      robustness on different levels of biological organization. The regulatory
      interlocking of several oscillating gene products in biological circadian
      oscillators may exist because it provides robustness.

TI  - Stochastic simulation of the mammalian circadian clock.
PG  - 321-4
AB  - Circadian (nearly 24-h) clocks are remarkably accurate at timing biological
      events despite the randomness of their biochemical reactions. Here we examine the
      causes of their immunity to molecular noise in the context of a detailed
      stochastic mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock. This stochastic
      model is a direct generalization of the deterministic mammalian circadian clock
      model previously developed. A feature of that model is that it completely
      specifies all molecular reactions, leaving no ambiguity in the formulation of a
      stochastic version of the model. With parameters based on experimental data
      concerning clock protein concentrations within a cell, we find accurate circadian
      rhythms in our model only when promoter interaction occurs on the time scale of
      seconds. As the model is scaled up by proportionally increasing the numbers of
      molecules of all species and the reaction rates with the promoter, the observed
      variability scales as 1/n(0.5), where n is the number of molecules of any
      species. Our results show that gene duplication increases robustness by providing
      more promoters with which the transcription factors of the model can interact.
      Although PER2 mutants were not rhythmic in the deterministic version of this
      model, they are rhythmic in the stochastic version.

TI  - Robustness properties of circadian clock architectures.
PG  - 13210-5
AB  - Robustness, a relative insensitivity to perturbations, is a key characteristic of
      living cells. However, the specific structural characteristics that are
      responsible for robust performance are not clear, even in genetic circuits of
      moderate complexity. Formal sensitivity analysis allows the investigation of
      robustness and fragility properties of mathematical models representing
      regulatory networks, but it yields only local properties with respect to a
      particular choice of parameter values. Here, we show that by systematically
      investigating the parameter space, more global properties linked to network
      structure can be derived. Our analysis focuses on the genetic oscillator
      responsible for generating circadian rhythms in Drosophila as a prototypic
      dynamical cellular system. Analysis of two mathematical models of moderate
      complexity shows that the tradeoff between robustness and fragility is largely
      determined by the regulatory structure. Rank-ordered sensitivities, for instance,
      allow the correct identification of protein phosphorylation as an influential
      process determining the oscillator's period. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis
      confirms the theoretical insight that hierarchical control might be important for
      achieving robustness. The complex feedback structures encountered in vivo,
      however, do not seem to enhance robustness per se but confer robust precision and
      adjustability of the clock while avoiding catastrophic failure.

TI  - Simulation of Drosophila circadian oscillations, mutations, and light responses
      by a model with VRI, PDP-1, and CLK.
PG  - 2786-802
AB  - A model of Drosophila circadian rhythm generation was developed to represent
      feedback loops based on transcriptional regulation of per, Clk (dclock), Pdp-1,
      and vri (vrille). The model postulates that histone acetylation kinetics make
      transcriptional activation a nonlinear function of [CLK]. Such a nonlinearity is 
      essential to simulate robust circadian oscillations of transcription in our model
      and in previous models. Simulations suggest that two positive feedback loops
      involving Clk are not essential for oscillations, because oscillations of [PER]
      were preserved when Clk, vri, or Pdp-1 expression was fixed. However, eliminating
      positive feedback by fixing vri expression altered the oscillation period.
      Eliminating the negative feedback loop in which PER represses per expression
      abolished oscillations. Simulations of per or Clk null mutations, of per
      overexpression, and of vri, Clk, or Pdp-1 heterozygous null mutations altered
      model behavior in ways similar to experimental data. The model simulated a photic
      phase-response curve resembling experimental curves, and oscillations entrained
      to simulated light-dark cycles. Temperature compensation of oscillation period
      could be simulated if temperature elevation slowed PER nuclear entry or PER
      phosphorylation. The model makes experimental predictions, some of which could be
      tested in transgenic Drosophila.

TI  - Gates and oscillators: a network model of the brain clock.
PG  - 339-50
AB  - The suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) control circadian oscillations of physiology and
      behavior. Measurements of electrical activity and of gene expression indicate
      that these heterogeneous structures are composed of both rhythmic and nonrhythmic
      cells. A fundamental question with regard to the organization of the circadian
      system is how the SCN achieve a coherent output while their constituent
      independent cellular oscillators express a wide range of periods. Previously, the
      consensus output of individual oscillators had been attributed to coupling among 
      cells. The authors propose a model that incorporates nonrhythmic "gate" cells and
      rhythmic oscillator cells with a wide range of periods, that neither requires nor
      excludes a role for interoscillator coupling. The gate provides daily input to
      oscillator cells and is in turn regulated (directly or indirectly) by the
      oscillator cells. In the authors' model, individual oscillators with initial
      random phases are able to self-assemble so as to maintain cohesive rhythmic
      output. In this view, SCN circuits are important for self-sustained oscillation, 
      and their network properties distinguish these nuclei from other tissues that
      rhythmically express clock genes. The model explains how individual SCN cells
      oscillate independently and yet work together to produce a coherent rhythm.

TI  - Toward a detailed computational model for the mammalian circadian clock.
PG  - 7051-6
AB  - We present a computational model for the mammalian circadian clock based on the
      intertwined positive and negative regulatory loops involving the Per, Cry, Bmal1,
      Clock, and Rev-Erb alpha genes. In agreement with experimental observations, the 
      model can give rise to sustained circadian oscillations in continuous darkness,
      characterized by an antiphase relationship between Per/Cry/Rev-Erbalpha and Bmal1
      mRNAs. Sustained oscillations correspond to the rhythms autonomously generated by
      suprachiasmatic nuclei. For other parameter values, damped oscillations can also 
      be obtained in the model. These oscillations, which transform into sustained
      oscillations when coupled to a periodic signal, correspond to rhythms produced by
      peripheral tissues. When incorporating the light-induced expression of the Per
      gene, the model accounts for entrainment of the oscillations by light-dark
      cycles. Simulations show that the phase of the oscillations can then vary by
      several hours with relatively minor changes in parameter values. Such a lability 
      of the phase could account for physiological disorders related to circadian
      rhythms in humans, such as advanced or delayed sleep phase syndrome, whereas the 
      lack of entrainment by light-dark cycles can be related to the non-24h sleep-wake
      syndrome. The model uncovers the possible existence of multiple sources of
      oscillatory behavior. Thus, in conditions where the indirect negative
      autoregulation of Per and Cry expression is inoperative, the model indicates the 
      possibility that sustained oscillations might still arise from the negative
      autoregulation of Bmal1 expression.

TI  - A reduced model clarifies the role of feedback loops and time delays in the
      Drosophila circadian oscillator.
PG  - 2349-59
AB  - Although several detailed models of molecular processes essential for circadian
      oscillations have been developed, their complexity makes intuitive understanding 
      of the oscillation mechanism difficult. The goal of the present study was to
      reduce a previously developed, detailed model to a minimal representation of the 
      transcriptional regulation essential for circadian rhythmicity in Drosophila. The
      reduced model contains only two differential equations, each with time delays. A 
      negative feedback loop is included, in which PER protein represses per
      transcription by binding the dCLOCK transcription factor. A positive feedback
      loop is also included, in which dCLOCK indirectly enhances its own formation. The
      model simulated circadian oscillations, light entrainment, and a phase-response
      curve with qualitative similarities to experiment. Time delays were found to be
      essential for simulation of circadian oscillations with this model. To examine
      the robustness of the simplified model to fluctuations in molecule numbers, a
      stochastic variant was constructed. Robust circadian oscillations and entrainment
      to light pulses were simulated with fewer than 80 molecules of each gene product 
      present on average. Circadian oscillations persisted when the positive feedback
      loop was removed. Moreover, elimination of positive feedback did not decrease the
      robustness of oscillations to stochastic fluctuations or to variations in
      parameter values. Such reduced models can aid understanding of the oscillation
      mechanisms in Drosophila and in other organisms in which feedback regulation of
      transcription may play an important role.

TI  - Robustness of circadian rhythms with respect to molecular noise.
PG  - 673-8
AB  - We use a core molecular model capable of generating circadian rhythms to assess
      the robustness of circadian oscillations with respect to molecular noise. The
      model is based on the negative feedback exerted by a regulatory protein on the
      expression of its gene. Such a negative regulatory mechanism underlies circadian 
      oscillations of the PER protein in Drosophila and of the FRQ protein in
      Neurospora. The model incorporates gene transcription into mRNA, translation of
      mRNA into protein, reversible phosphorylation leading to degradation of the
      regulatory protein, transport of the latter into the nucleus, and repression of
      gene expression by the nuclear form of the protein. To assess the effect of
      molecular noise, we perform stochastic simulations after decomposing the
      deterministic model into elementary reaction steps. The oscillations predicted by
      the stochastic simulations agree with those obtained with the deterministic
      version of the model. We show that robust circadian oscillations can occur
      already with a limited number of mRNA and protein molecules, in the range of tens
      and hundreds, respectively. Entrainment by light/dark cycles and cooperativity in
      repression enhance the robustness of circadian oscillations with respect to
      molecular noise.

TI  - Expression of Period genes: rhythmic and nonrhythmic compartments of the
      suprachiasmatic nucleus pacemaker.
PG  - 7742-50
AB  - The mammalian circadian clock lying in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls
      daily rhythms and synchronizes the organism to its environment. In all organisms 
      studied, circadian timekeeping is cell-autonomous, and rhythmicity is thought to 
      be generated by a feedback loop involving clock proteins that inhibit
      transcription of their own genes. In the present study, we examined how these
      cellular properties are organized within the SCN tissue to produce rhythmicity
      and photic entrainment. The results show that the SCN has two compartments
      regulating Period genes Per1, Per2, and Per3 mRNA expression differentially. One 
      compartment shows endogenous rhythmicity in Per1, Per2, and Per3 mRNA expression.
      The other compartment does not have rhythmic mRNA expression but has gated
      light-induced Per1 and Per2 and high levels of endogenous nonrhythmic Per3 mRNA
      expression. These results reveal the occurrence of differential regulation of
      clock genes in two distinct SCN regions and suggest a potential mechanism for
      producing functional differences in distinct SCN subregions.

TI  - Conceptual translation of timeless reveals alternative initiating methionines in 
      Drosophila.
PG  - 455-8
AB  - We have sequenced genomic fragments which encode the N-terminus of the TIMELESS
      (TIM) clock protein in Drosophila simulans and D. yakuba. We observe that in
      these two species, the initiating methionine appears to lie downstream of the one
      proposed to encode the translational start inD.melanogaster, thereby truncating
      the N-terminus by 23 amino acids. We then sequenced the corresponding 5'fragment 
      in a number of D. melanogaster individuals from different strains. We observed a 
      polymorphism which strongly suggests that the originally proposed start site
      cannot be utilised in some individuals, and that these flies will initiate
      translation of TIM at the downstream ATG. Given the current interest in TIM
      regulation in D. melanogaster, it is important to correctly define the N-terminus
      in this species.
